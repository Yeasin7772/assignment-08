                        <li class="py-4 font-medium">Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their 
                        containing function or global scope. This means you can access them before they are actually declared in the code, but they will be initialized with undefined.</li>
                        <li class="py-4 font-medium">Re-declaration: You can re-declare a variable using var within the same scope, 
                        which can lead to unintended issues.</li>
                        <li class="py-4 font-medium">Global Scope: If declared outside of any function,
                             var variables become global and are accessible throughout the entire script.</li>

                    <li class="py-4 font-medium">Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared.</li>
                        <li class="py-4 font-medium">Hoisting: Like var, let variables are hoisted but are not initialized. Attempting to access a let variable before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError..</li>

                <h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold text-emerald-200 "> `API:`</h1>
                <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
                 For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.</p>

            <div class="p-6">
                <h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold text-fuchsia-300"> How REST API work</h1>
                <p>REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A 
                well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.</p>
